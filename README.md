# Collectivo

This project has a Phoenix backend and a React frontend. This is a monorepo,
but they are separate apps.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `PORT=4444 mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4444`](http://localhost:4444) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

To start the frontend development server:

  * Change directories with `cd frontend`
  * Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  * Start webpack dev server with `yarn start`

This will open a browser tab at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
with the frontend running.
